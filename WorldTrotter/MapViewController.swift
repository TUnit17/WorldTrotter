        // Each view has an autoresizing mask
        // By default, iOS creates constraints that match the autoresizing mask and adds them to the view.
        // These translated constraints will often conflict with explicit constraints in the layout and cause an insatisfiable constraints problem.
        // The fix is to turn off this default translation by setting the property translateAutoresizingMaskIntoContraints to false.

        /**
         What is an anchor?
         Fact:  When you work with Auto Layout programmatically, you will use anchors to create your constraints
         Anchors are properties on the view that correspond to attributes that you might want to constrain to an anchor on another view.
         For example, you might want to constrain the leading anchor of one view to the leading anchor of another view.
         This would have the effect of two view's leading edges being aligned
         
         I think an anchor is giving a variable name to a constraint
        **/
        
        
        /**
         The top anchor of the segmented control should be equal to the top anchor of its superview
         //let topConstraint = segmentedControl.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.topAnchor)
         Problem : This does not look good becuase the segmented control is underlapping the status bar
         Solution: make the segmented control to be 8 points below the top layout guide
         Fact    : By using layout guides instead of hardcoded constant, the views will adapt based on the context they appear in.
         
         What is a layout guide?
         Indicate the extent to which the view controller's view contents will be visible. 
         
         What is the topLayoutGuide?
         Allows your content to not underlap the status bar or navigation bar at the top of the screen
         
         What is the bottomLayouGuide?
         Allows your content to not underlap thhe tab bar at the bottom of the screen 
         
         Fact : There are 3 types of layout guid anchors ( topAnchor, bottomAnchor, heightAnchor) 
         
         What does bottomAnchor mean? 
         because you want the segmented control to be under the status bar, you will constrain the bottom anchor of the top layout guide

        // What does .equalTo mean?

        // Problem with this code: the bar on top touches the side margins
        // let leadingConstraint = segmentedControl.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor)
